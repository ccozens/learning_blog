#Context vs stores
From chatGPT:

##Context

###Pros:

1. Simplicity: Context in Svelte is straightforward to set up and use. It allows you to pass data from a parent component to its descendants without explicitly passing props through every level of the component tree.
2. Flexibility: Context is dynamic, meaning the context value can change over time, and components subscribed to the context will automatically update accordingly.
3. Shared state management: Context is useful when multiple components need access to the same data. It provides a centralized way to manage shared state without resorting to prop drilling.

###Cons:

1. Performance impact: Context updates can potentially trigger unnecessary re-renders in components that consume the context. It's important to be mindful of the context value and update frequency to avoid performance bottlenecks.
2. Complexity in larger applications: As the application grows, managing multiple contexts and their interdependencies can become challenging. Overusing context or nesting multiple contexts can lead to code complexity and reduced maintainability.


##Stores

###Pros:

1. Reactive data: Stores in Svelte, such as the writable and readable stores, provide reactive data that triggers updates in components when the store value changes. This enables efficient reactivity without causing unnecessary re-renders.
2. Centralized state management: Stores allow you to centralize and manage application state. They provide a clean separation between state management and component logic, making it easier to reason about and maintain the application's data flow.
3. Fine-grained control: Stores offer more granular control over state updates compared to context. You can define specific actions and mutations for modifying the store value, enforcing encapsulation and data integrity.

###Cons:

1. Learning curve: Stores in Svelte have a slightly steeper learning curve compared to context due to their additional concepts and methods like subscribe, update, and set.
Additional setup: Stores require explicit creation and management, which involves additional code compared to using context. However, Svelte provides built-in store utilities to simplify the process.
2. Overuse concerns: Using stores excessively can lead to overly complex state management, especially in smaller applications where simpler solutions like props or context might suffice.


##Summary
In summary, both context and stores have their own strengths and weaknesses. Context is simpler to set up and more suitable for smaller applications with relatively straightforward data sharing needs. On the other hand, stores provide more powerful state management capabilities, making them a good choice for larger applications or when fine-grained control over state updates is required. Consider the specific requirements and complexity of your project when deciding between context and stores.
